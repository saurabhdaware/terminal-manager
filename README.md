## Features

By default vscode lets us define only one link of terminal from settings.

Using this extension you can provide an array of terminals and then you can switch between them from a new Terminal icon in activity bar.

## Extension Settings

Click the edit icon ![](resources/edit.png) in Terminal Manager activity bar to edit the terminal settings.

Here's what sample terminals.json looks like. (Note : Ubuntu configs will only work if you have wsl installed in your windows)

### In Windows :
```json
[
    {
        "label":"Windows",
        "shellPath":"C://Windows//System32//cmd.exe",
        "shellArgs":[
            "/K",
            "echo Heya!"
        ]
    },
    {
        "label":"Ubuntu",
        "shellPath":"C://Windows//System32//bash.exe"
    }
]
```

### In Linux and OSX:
```json
[
    {
        "label":"Login bash",
        "shellPath":"/bin/bash",
        "shellArgs":["-l"]
    },
    {
        "label": "Restricted Bash",
        "shellPath": "/bin/rbash"
    },
    {
        "label":"sh",
        "shellPath":"/bin/sh"
    }

```
